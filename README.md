# CS M146: Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains my work and course material for CS M146, taken under Professor [Sriram Sankararaman](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/) in Winter 2023. The class is largely based on Hal Daume III's "A Course in Machine Learning" (CIML).

Software used: Python
Tools used: Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

## Course Material
- Supervised learning
- Decision Trees (CIML 1)
- Nearest neighbors (CIML 3)
- Linear classification (perceptron) (CIML 4)
- Logistic regression (CIML 9.1-9.2,9.6-9.7)
- Naive Bayes
- Linear regression (CIML 6-6.2, 6.4-6.6)
- Overfitting and regularization (CIML 2) + Evaluation
- Neural Nets (CIML 10)
- Learning theory (CIML 12)
- Kernels (CIML 11)
- SVMs (CIML 7.7)
- Multi-class classification
- Ensemble methods (CIML 13)
- PCA (CIML 15.2)
- Clustering (CIML 15.1)
- Mixture models
- HMMs

CS M146's winter 2023 iteration comprised of four problem sets, the content of which can be found in `/Problem Sets`.
